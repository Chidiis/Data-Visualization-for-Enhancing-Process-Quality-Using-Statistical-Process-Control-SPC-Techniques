# Data Visualization for Enhancing Process Quality Using Statistical Process Control (SPC) Techniques

**Author:** Chidiebere Sam-Ogbonna

## Objective
To visualize manufacturing process data using Statistical Process Control (SPC) techniques to identify, monitor, and improve process quality in a polyurethane foam production company.

## Key Components of the project

### Creation of Synthetic Dataset
A synthetic dataset is generated to simulate manufacturing process data. This dataset includes variables such as:
- `BatchNumber`
- `Density`
- `Hardness`
- `TensileStrength`
- `Temperature`
- `MixingTime`
- `RawMaterialQuality`

### Loading and Inspecting the Dataset
The synthetic dataset is loaded into the analysis environment, and initial inspections are performed:
- Displaying the first few rows
- Generating summary statistics
- Checking for missing values

### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning steps are undertaken to prepare the dataset for analysis:
- Checking data types
- Converting categorical variables
- Removing missing values and duplicates

### Descriptive Statistics and Visualization
Descriptive statistics are calculated to summarize the data. Various visualizations are created to provide insights into the data distribution and relationships among variables. Initial visualizations include:
- Density distributions
- Other relevant plots

## Detailed Analyses and SPC Techniques
The document continues with more detailed analyses and visualizations, focusing on applying SPC techniques to monitor and improve the quality of the manufacturing process.

## Conclusion
The overall aim is to leverage data-driven insights to enhance process quality and efficiency in the polyurethane foam production company.
